/**
 * CDN delivery for Web Awesome — optional.
 *
 * By default this design system registers custom elements from the vendored
 * bundle in ./vendor, so nothing is fetched from a third party at runtime.
 * CDN mode is the alternative: the browser loads Web Awesome's own autoloader
 * from a version-pinned CDN, which then registers each element on demand.
 *
 *   Bundle mode  — no network dependency, one larger JS file up front.
 *   CDN mode     — smaller app payload, lazily loaded elements, but the page
 *                  depends on the CDN being reachable.
 *
 * Two CDNs are in play, deliberately:
 *
 *   Stylesheets come from jsDelivr, which serves the published files verbatim
 *   (see ./theme.css). The URLs are exported here too, for projects that
 *   prefer <link> tags in the document head over the CSS import.
 *
 *   JavaScript comes from esm.sh, which rewrites the package's bare imports
 *   into resolvable URLs. Web Awesome's published modules import bare
 *   specifiers (@shoelace-style/animations, @shoelace-style/localize, Lit's
 *   SSR client), so loading them straight off jsDelivr fails in the browser
 *   with "Failed to resolve module specifier" unless the page ships an
 *   import map for every one of them.
