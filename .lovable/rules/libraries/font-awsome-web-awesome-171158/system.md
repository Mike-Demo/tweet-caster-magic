# Web Awesome Design System

This design system wraps **Web Awesome 3.12.0** — the free, open-source web component library from the Font Awesome team (MIT licensed) — plus **Font Awesome Free 7.3.1** for iconography. Nothing is installed from npm at runtime: element definitions ship as a self-contained vendor bundle inside the design system, and the stylesheets load from a version-pinned CDN. Components are available both as typed React wrappers (`<WaButton variant="brand">`) and as raw custom elements (`<wa-button>`) written directly in JSX; all styling flows through `--wa-*` design tokens and CSS layers. There is no CSS-in-JS, no Tailwind, and no theme provider component.

## Setup (do this once per app)

1. **Theme CSS** — link the design system's `theme.css` in the root route head (TanStack: `import themeCss from "<design-system folder>/webawesome/theme.css?url"` and add `{ rel: "stylesheet", href: themeCss }` to `head().links`). This single file loads Web Awesome's base styles, the default theme + palette, layout/text utilities, and Font Awesome Free from a version-pinned CDN (`@import`s at the top of the file). Alternatively, importing the design system's barrel pulls the theme in as a side effect.
2. **Root classes** — set `class="wa-theme-default wa-palette-default wa-light"` on `<html>` (exported as `WEB_AWESOME_HTML_CLASSES` from the design system's `setup` module). Swap `wa-light` → `wa-dark` for dark mode; both themes are token-complete.
3. **Component loader** — render `<WebAwesomeLoader />` (from the design system's `setup` module) once, mounted INSIDE routed page content (e.g. a shared layout the route components render), not above lazy route boundaries such as the root route. After the surrounding tree hydrates it dynamically imports `webawesome/vendor/webawesome.bundle.js`, which registers all 70 `<wa-*>` elements and pins the icon path. The vendor bundle is required: Web Awesome's autoloader resolves component files by URL at runtime (404s under a bundler), and CDN module loading fails too — its dist modules import bare specifiers, and per-module CDN builds duplicate `wa-icon` and throw on the second `define()`. Rebuild the bundle with `bun scripts/build-vendor.ts` after bumping the pinned Web Awesome version. Mounting the loader above a lazy route can register elements mid-hydration and trigger React hydration-mismatch warnings. Never import component modules statically in SSR-evaluated code — they touch `document` at module scope and crash the server render.
4. **Types** — the design system folder ships `types.d.ts`, a self-contained declaration that types every `<wa-*>` tag in JSX. It works automatically once the folder is under `src/`. The React wrappers under `webawesome/react/` carry per-component prop types.

## Delivery modes (bundle, CDN, optional SSR)

`<WebAwesomeLoader />` takes two optional props; the defaults are what every app should use unless there is a reason not to.

- **`source="bundle"` (default)** — element definitions come from the vendored bundle inside the design system. No third-party request at runtime, works offline, one larger file up front.
- **`source="cdn"`** — loads Web Awesome's own autoloader from a version-pinned CDN (`webawesome.loader.js`) and lets it register elements on demand. Modules are served by esm.sh, not jsDelivr: Web Awesome's published files import bare package names (`@shoelace-style/animations`, `@shoelace-style/localize`, Lit's SSR client) that a browser cannot resolve without an import map. The helper also configures the base path and icon path *before* importing the autoloader, since it starts registering elements as soon as it evaluates. Smaller app payload; the page then depends on the CDN. Pinned URLs and `loadWebAwesomeFromCdn()` live in the design system's `cdn` module, which also exports the stylesheet URLs for apps that prefer `<link>` tags over the `theme.css` import.
- **`hydrate`** — loads the hydration-aware build (`webawesome.ssr.bundle.js`, or `webawesome.ssr-loader.js` in CDN mode). Turn this on **only** when `<wa-*>` markup is server-rendered with declarative shadow DOM. It also sets `data-wa-ssr` on `<html>`, which activates a `theme.css` rule hiding not-yet-defined elements that were not server-rendered.
- **Server rendering is opt-in and experimental.** `webawesome/ssr/render.server` wraps Web Awesome's `render-string` and is the one piece that needs npm packages (`@awesome.me/webawesome` plus Lit's SSR packages) at runtime — it is intentionally not exported from the barrel. Treat it as build-time / Node rendering, never a hot serverless request path, and never import it from client code.
- **When server rendering, respect its rules.** Add the matching `with-*` attribute for every conditionally slotted region (`with-header`, `with-footer`, `with-label`, ...) — slot detection does not work on the server. Before setting a property on an element, `await customElements.whenDefined(tag)` and then its `updateComplete`, or Lit throws a hydration error. `<wa-icon>` renders empty, `<wa-qr-code>` and charts stay blank until the browser connects, localization falls back to English, and `dir` is not inherited. SSR is an initial-markup optimization, not a no-JavaScript experience.

## Using components

- Prefer the typed React wrappers: `import { WaButton, WaIcon } from "<design-system folder>"` → `<WaButton variant="brand" size="l">Save</WaButton>`. Each wrapper documents its attributes, defaults, slots, and events in its props type, forwards refs to the custom element, merges `className`, and drops `false` booleans (a present boolean attribute is true to Web Awesome).
- Raw tags also work and are equivalent: `<wa-button variant="brand">Save</wa-button>`. `<WebAwesomeLoader />` registers every tag client-side either way.
- Component APIs (attributes, slots, events, CSS parts) are documented in the wrapper props types and in Web Awesome's published component reference — consult them before styling or wiring events. Never guess part names or token mappings.
- Custom element events (`wa-show`, `wa-hide`, `wa-input`, `wa-change`, …) are DOM events: attach listeners via a `ref` in `useEffect`, or drive element properties imperatively (`dialogRef.current.open = true`). React's `onChange` does not fire for Web Awesome form controls; use the element's own events.
- For imperative work, type the ref as `HTMLElement` and set properties directly (`dialogRef.current.open = true`); wrappers forward the ref to the host element.

## Layout

- Full pages, app shells: `<wa-page>` owns the viewport — header/nav/main/footer via slots; nav goes in `slot="navigation"` exactly once (sidebar on desktop, drawer on mobile, automatically). Reset `html, body { min-height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0 }` and zero the main padding for full-bleed sections.
- Sections, cards, widgets: compose with utility classes — `wa-stack` (vertical), `wa-cluster` (inline wrap), `wa-grid` (responsive columns), `wa-flank`, `wa-split`, `wa-frame` — plus `wa-gap-*`, `wa-align-items-*`, `wa-justify-content-*`. Never hand-roll flex/grid CSS for what these cover.

## Icons

- Use `<wa-icon name="star">` for all icons — **never emojis**, anywhere (logos, alt text, bullets, toasts included).
- Free families only: default solid (`<wa-icon name="bell">`), regular (`family="classic" variant="regular"`), and brands (`family="brands" name="github"`). No kit codes, no Pro families (sharp, duotone, thin, light are Pro).
- `<wa-icon>` resolves SVGs from Font Awesome's free keyless CDN. The vendor bundle calls `setIconPath()` for the pinned Font Awesome version *before* any element registers — Web Awesome hardcodes an older FA release, so newer icons 403 without the pin, and setting it after import is too late (the first icon resolves as it upgrades). `FONT_AWESOME_VERSION` lives in both `setup.tsx` and `scripts/build-vendor.ts`; keep them in sync. For fully self-hosted icons, point that path at a copied `svgs/` directory.
- Font Awesome's CSS classes (`<i class="fa-solid fa-star">`) also work — `theme.css` loads the pinned Font Awesome stylesheet and webfonts. Prefer `<wa-icon>` in components; the classes are for markdown/CMS content where custom elements are awkward.
- Give icon-only controls a `label` attribute (Web Awesome components) or `aria-label`.

## Standard footer & license page (required in every app)

- **Footer.** Every app renders `<SiteFooter />` (from the design system barrel, or `<design-system folder>/webawesome/patterns`) exactly once, at the bottom of the app shell — inside `<wa-page>` use `<div slot="footer"><SiteFooter /></div>`. It ships the standard content: "Made by MikeDemo", the current year, an "Open Source" link, and LinkedIn / X / Threads links with brand icons. Never hand-roll a footer, and never restyle this one beyond passing its props (`madeBy`, `licensesHref`, `socialLinks`, `year`, `className`). The year resolves after hydration, so it is SSR-safe.

- **Bot protection.** Use `<HCaptcha siteKey={...} />` from the design system patterns for captchas on sign-up, login, and public contact forms — never embed hCaptcha's script by hand or hand-roll a widget. The site key is public and belongs in client code; the secret key never does. Always verify the returned token server-side (`POST https://api.hcaptcha.com/siteverify` from a server function) before trusting a submission, and credit hCaptcha on the licenses page when the component is used. Use `size="invisible"` plus the `execute()` ref handle when the challenge should run from your own submit button.
- **License page.** Every app ships a `/licenses` route rendering `<LicensesPage />`. Its links are plain `<a href>` so the pattern stays router-agnostic; keep the route path at `/licenses` (or pass `licensesHref` to the footer if it must differ).
- **Credits are mandatory.** `baseCredits` covers Web Awesome, Font Awesome Free, React, and TanStack. Whenever the app adds a typeface, icon set, artwork, library, or data source, add a `LicenseEntry` for it — name, author, license, URL, and a note on where it is used — and group entries with `groups={[{ title, entries }]}` (typical groups: Typeface, Artwork, Open source libraries, Data sources). Shipping an uncredited third-party asset is a defect.

## Hard constraints

- **Tokens only.** Every color, space, radius, shadow, and font size comes from `--wa-*` tokens or `wa-*` utilities. Raw hex/px/rem literals are defects; the sole exception is a deliberate brand override inside `theme.css`'s `@layer wa-theme` block.
- **Never style through the shadow DOM blindly.** Order: attributes (`variant`, `appearance`, `size`, `pill`) → the component's documented custom properties → its documented `::part()`. `background`/`color` on a `<wa-button>` host styles an invisible wrapper — use `::part(base)`.
- **One `variant="brand"` button per view region.** Demote the rest to `appearance="outlined"` or `"plain"`, and never place an outlined button whose variant matches the band color it sits on.
- **Free tier only.** Do not use Pro-only components (`wa-combobox`, `wa-file-input`, chart/video families) or Pro icon families, and never embed a kit code.
- **SSR discipline.** `<wa-*>` markup (and wrapper output) server-renders as plain HTML and upgrades client-side — that is correct and expected. Server rendering the shadow roots is optional (see Delivery modes) and requires `<WebAwesomeLoader hydrate />`. Never import the vendor bundle in server functions or at module scope of SSR-evaluated code; it touches `document`. The wrappers themselves are SSR-safe.
- **No npm dependency for consumers.** Never reintroduce a runtime `@awesome.me/webawesome` or `@fortawesome/*` import in `src/webawesome/` (outside the vendor bundle build). Both packages are devDependencies of this project only.
- **Accessibility baseline.** Real heading elements for hierarchy, `label` on every form control and icon-only button, meaningful `alt` text, keyboard-reachable interactive states.
- **Custom CSS is the exception.** Work down the ladder: existing component → layout utility → token → component styling API → only then a small token-based custom rule. Never a parallel design language.
- **Theme changes go through the brand file.** Retune the system with the `ThemeEditor` (`@/webawesome/theme-editor`) and save; the generated tokens land in `src/webawesome/brand.css`, inside `@layer wa-theme`, which is the ONLY place raw color values may appear. Never scatter `--wa-*` overrides across component stylesheets, never hardcode a hex/px value in a component, and never treat the editor's browser-stored preview as shipped configuration — an unsaved override exists only in that browser.
